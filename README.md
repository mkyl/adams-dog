# Help Us Find Adams Dog

First check [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SkFcZgmzvBuB4LUJjxDwDxqWGS1LWBauwhXssd8MjQo/edit) to find a range that we have not found yet.

Run this script like this:

> python3 concat-and-factor.py <first number> <second number>

where <first number> and <second number> are the start and end of the index of the digit we want. Paste the results you get into the spreadsheet.
